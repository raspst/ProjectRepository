This is a Pathfinder character creator I'm making just for fun in Java.
In the end, I want the user to be able to choose a class and race and have
the program take care of calculating their base attack bonus, saving throws,
HP, racial abilities, etc so that the player can quickly make a character.
There are lots of tools for this already out there, but I figure it's
something I like that I can put together. Right now, it just allows for
the user to set their attributes (Strength, Dexterity, etc) using a point-buy
system with 25 points.

Pathfinder is owned entirely by Paizo, Inc. I'm sure this is covered
by fair use, but if they ask me to take it down for some reason, I'll comply.
